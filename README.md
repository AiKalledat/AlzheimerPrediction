# Alzheimer Prediction

Alzheimerâ€™s Disease (AD) presents a global health challenge, requiring accurate and early detection for effective clinical intervention. Our project focuses on machine learning and neural network approaches to predict binary-coded Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scores in cross-sectional (OASIS-I) and longitudinal (OASIS-II) datasets. Testing six machine learning models and two neural networks, logistic regression achieved the highest balanced accuracy of 80.7% (10-fold cross-validation) for cross-sectional CDR prediction, while LSTM showed a comparable 80% balanced accuracy for longitudinal CDR prediction. This project contributes to AD detection efforts using machine learning models and neural networks from electronic health records.
